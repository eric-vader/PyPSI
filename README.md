# PyPSI
A Python library for private set intersection

We'd like to have a library where we could perform private set intersection over a variety of different approaches. The following features of this library are important to us:
- Support for Paillier HME
- Support for SEAL HME
- Identical API for any algorithm
- Complete interoperability with other OpenMined PSI libraries, allowing you to create keys in one language and use them in another

For SEAL, we could use the following: https://github.com/OpenMined/tenseal
